# Common Issues

Solutions to frequently encountered problems with Ukkin.

## Installation Issues

### `flutter pub get` fails resolving `agentlib`

**Symptoms:** "Could not find a file named pubspec.yaml in ../agentlib" or path resolution errors.

**Solutions:**
1. Ukkin's `pubspec.yaml` declares `agentlib: path: ../agentlib`. Clone it as a sibling:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neul-labs/agentlib.git ../agentlib
   ```
2. Re-run `flutter pub get` from the `ukkin` directory.
3. If you previously had a stale lockfile: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`.

### App Crashes on First Launch

**Symptoms:** App closes immediately or shows "Ukkin has stopped"

**Solutions:**
1. Restart your device
2. Clear app cache and data
3. Confirm `QuickStart.initialize(...)` is not throwing - check logs via `flutter logs`
4. Verify minimum platform: Android API 21+ or iOS 11+

### Model Fails to Load

**Symptoms:** "Failed to initialize AI model" error

**Solutions:**
1. Wait a few minutes (first load can take time)
2. Ensure 2GB free storage
3. Close other apps to free memory
4. Restart the app
5. Re-download if model is corrupted

## Agent Issues

### Agent Not Running

**Symptoms:** Agent shows as active but never executes

**Solutions:**
1. Check accessibility service is enabled
2. Disable battery optimization for Ukkin
3. Ensure background activity is allowed
4. Check if quiet hours are active
5. Verify schedule is set correctly

### Agent Gets Stuck

**Symptoms:** Agent starts but never completes

**Solutions:**
1. Add longer wait times between steps
2. Check if target app is updated (UI may have changed)
3. Verify the element text/buttons still exist
4. Increase step timeout in settings
5. Run manually to observe where it fails

### Agent Taps Wrong Element

**Symptoms:** Agent clicks something other than intended

**Solutions:**
1. Use more specific element identifiers
2. Add wait_for conditions before tapping
3. Use text-based targeting instead of position
4. Check for overlapping elements

### Agent Can't Find Element

**Symptoms:** "Element not found" errors

**Solutions:**
1. Verify the text/element exists on screen
2. Increase wait time before looking for element
3. Check if element is hidden behind a menu
4. Update element identifier if app was updated

### Agent Actions Have No Effect

**Symptoms:** Agent runs but nothing happens in the target app

**Solutions:**
1. Re-enable accessibility service
2. Check if app is on the blocklist
3. Verify agent has permission for that app
4. Restart device
5. Try longer tap duration

## Chat Issues

### AI Responses Are Slow

**Symptoms:** Takes more than 10 seconds to respond

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce context length in settings
2. Close background apps
3. Use CPU instead of GPU (may be more stable)
4. Reduce max tokens
5. Restart the app

### AI Doesn't Understand

**Symptoms:** Irrelevant or confused responses

**Solutions:**
1. Be more specific in your request
2. Use simpler language
3. Break complex requests into smaller parts
4. Clear chat history and try again

### Chat History Lost

**Symptoms:** Previous messages disappeared

**Solutions:**
1. Check if auto-cleanup deleted old messages
2. Verify storage permissions
3. History may be in different conversation
4. Database may need repair (try clearing cache)

## Permission Issues

### Accessibility Service Keeps Disabling

**Symptoms:** Service turns off randomly

**Solutions:**
1. Disable battery optimization for Ukkin
2. Lock Ukkin in recent apps
3. Enable auto-start permission
4. Check security apps that may be interfering

### Can't Enable Accessibility Service

**Symptoms:** Toggle doesn't work or resets

**Solutions:**
1. Restart device
2. Clear system settings cache
3. Check if parental controls are blocking
4. Try in Safe Mode

### Permission Dialogs Don't Appear

**Symptoms:** No prompt when permission is needed

**Solutions:**
1. Go to system settings manually
2. Clear app data and retry
3. Check if permission was previously denied
4. Reinstall the app

## Notification Issues

### Not Receiving Notifications

**Symptoms:** Agents run but no alerts

**Solutions:**
1. Check system notification settings
2. Verify Ukkin has notification permission
3. Disable Do Not Disturb
4. Check quiet hours in Ukkin settings
5. Ensure notifications aren't grouped/silent

### Too Many Notifications

**Symptoms:** Overwhelmed by alerts

**Solutions:**
1. Change to summary mode
2. Set up quiet hours
3. Reduce check frequency on agents
4. Adjust per-agent notification settings

## Performance Issues

### High Battery Drain

**Symptoms:** Battery depletes quickly when using Ukkin

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce number of active agents
2. Increase check intervals
3. Enable battery saver mode
4. Use WiFi-only mode
5. Reduce max concurrent agents

### Device Gets Hot

**Symptoms:** Phone heats up during agent execution

**Solutions:**
1. Switch from GPU to CPU processing
2. Reduce concurrent agents to 1
3. Add longer waits between actions
4. Let device cool between executions

### App Using Too Much Storage

**Symptoms:** Low storage warnings

**Solutions:**
1. Clear old screenshots
2. Reduce log retention period
3. Delete unused agents
4. Clear app cache
5. Export and delete old data

## Data Issues

### Can't Export Data
